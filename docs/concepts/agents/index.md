## What Are Agents?

Agents are automated, AI-powered entities that can perform tasks, make decisions, and take actions on your behalf within a digital environment. In the context of knowledge graphs, agents operate as specialized assistants that can interact with your data in purposeful ways.

## Key Capabilities

#### Autonomous Operation

Agents can monitor your knowledge graph, perform scheduled tasks, and respond to events without constant human oversight.

#### Goal-Oriented Behavior

Unlike passive tools, agents actively work toward specific objectivesâ€”finding insights, alerting to changes, or updating information based on predefined criteria.

#### Specialized Functions

Agents typically have focused roles such as data validation, pattern recognition, or relationship discovery within your knowledge graph.

## Agents and Knowledge Graphs

### How They Work Together

#### Active Data Management

Agents can continuously improve your knowledge graph by identifying missing connections, suggesting new relationships, or cleaning inconsistent data.

#### Intelligent Navigation

By understanding the structure of your knowledge graph, agents can efficiently traverse complex relationships to find relevant information or discover hidden patterns.

#### Contextual Decision Making

Agents use the rich context provided by your knowledge graph to make more informed decisions about data quality, relevance, and significance.

#### Automated Enrichment

Agents can supplement your knowledge graph by retrieving additional information from external sources when gaps are identified.

## Practical Benefits

#### Continuous Optimization

Agents maintain and enhance your knowledge graph over time, ensuring it remains accurate and useful as your business evolves.

#### Proactive Insights

Instead of waiting for users to query information, agents can identify important patterns or anomalies and bring them to your attention.

#### Workflow Automation

Agents can trigger actions based on changes in your knowledge graph, automating routine processes and decision points.

#### Enhanced User Experience

By handling repetitive tasks and surfacing relevant information, agents allow users to focus on higher-level analysis and decision making.

Agents transform your knowledge graph from a static repository into an active, evolving system that continuously works to provide value and insights aligned with your business objectives.
