## What is Data Integration?

Data integration is the process of combining information from different sources into one unified view. In your knowledge graph application, it allows users to bring together data from various business systems to create a more complete picture.

```console
Data integration transforms your knowledge graph from an isolated tool
into a central hub that brings together your organization's collective knowledge.
```

## Key Methods

- **API Integration** - Connects directly to other software systems for real-time data exchange
- **CSV Import / Export** - Allows uploading or extracting simple data files for use either in Brickgraph or into other applications

## Why Data Integration Matters

### Creates a Complete Picture

By connecting data from different departments and systems (like sales, inventory, customer service), users can see relationships that were previously hidden.

### Saves Time and Reduces Errors

Instead of manually copying information between systems or spreadsheets, automated integration keeps data consistent and up-to-date.

### Enables Better Decision Making

With comprehensive data in one place, users can make decisions based on the full picture rather than partial information.

### Builds a Single Source of Truth

Eliminates conflicting information by establishing one authoritative version of each data point.
