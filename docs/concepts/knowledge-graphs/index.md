### What is a knowledge graph?

A knowledge graph is a way of organizing information that shows how different pieces of data connect to each other. Unlike traditional databases that store information in tables or lists, knowledge graphs represent information as a network of interconnected concepts.

### How they work

Think of a knowledge graph like a map of your business knowledge. There are three main components to a knowledge graph:

1. **Entities** represent things (like customers, products, locations, or events). _Sometimes called Nodes or Vertices_.
2. **Relationships** show how these things relate to each other (like "customer purchased product" or "location contains inventory"). _Sometimes called Edges or Connections_.
3. **Fields** are properties that can be assigned to either Entities or Relationships. They can be formatted as text, numbers, dates, addresses, and more. _Sometimes called Properties or Attributes_

With a knowledge graph data model made up of Entities and Relationships (that each have respective Fields) nearly any model - or map, if you like - can be designed and developed.

### Examples

Your knowledge graph might connect a customer to their purchase history, which connects to products, which connect to suppliers, which connect to locationsâ€”all creating a rich web of business relationships.

The power of knowledge graphs comes from their ability to:

1. Reveal hidden connections between different parts of your business
2. Answer complex questions that span multiple areas of your organization
3. Provide context by showing how information is related
4. Adapt easily as your business and data needs change

With Brickgraph, you'll be able to visualize these connections, discover new insights, and make better decisions based on a complete picture of your business data.
