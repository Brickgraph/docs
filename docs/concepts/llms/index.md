### What Are LLMs?

Large Language Models are AI systems trained on vast amounts of text data that can understand, generate, and manipulate human language. They can answer questions, write content, summarize information, and perform many other language-based tasks. Popular examples are OpenAI's GPT 4 or Claude from Anthropic.

LLMs powered by knowledge graphs transform from general-purpose AI into
specialized assistants that understand your business's unique information
landscape, delivering responses that are accurate, relevant,
and tailored to your specific context.
```

### Key Capabilities

- **Natural language understanding** - Comprehending the meaning and context of questions
- **Content generation** - Creating coherent and relevant text responses
- **Context awareness** - Maintaining the thread of a conversation
- **Knowledge application** - Drawing on training data to provide information

### LLMs and Knowledge Graphs

When LLMs are integrated with knowledge graphs, they become more powerful and precise:

#### Grounded Responses

Knowledge graphs provide factual anchoring, helping LLMs give answers based on your specific business data rather than general information from their training.

#### Contextual Understanding

By referencing your knowledge graph, LLMs can understand the relationships between entities in your business, making responses more relevant to your specific context.

#### Enhanced Accuracy

Instead of approximating answers, LLMs can query your knowledge graph for precise information about your products, customers, or operations.

#### Reduced Hallucinations

Knowledge graphs help prevent LLMs from generating plausible but incorrect information by providing verified data sources.

### Practical Benefits

#### Personalized Interactions

LLMs can reference your knowledge graph to provide answers tailored to specific customer profiles, product lines, or business units.

#### Complex Query Resolution

By navigating the connections in your knowledge graph, LLMs can answer multi-step questions that require understanding relationships between different business entities.

#### Knowledge Discovery

LLMs can identify patterns and connections within your knowledge graph that might not be immediately obvious to human users.

#### Consistent Information

By drawing on your knowledge graph's "single source of truth," LLMs provide consistent answers across all interactions.
