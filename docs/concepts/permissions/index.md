## What Are Permissions?

Permissions control what users can see and do within your knowledge graph application. They create boundaries that protect sensitive information while allowing appropriate access based on each user's role.

```console
Permissions transform your knowledge graph from a vulnerable repository
into a secure, collaborative platform where information flows
appropriately based on user roles and needs.
```

## Permission Levels

Your application offers four carefully designed permission levels:

#### Admin

- Can modify the structure of your graph (data model, aka "schema")
- Can edit data
- Have access to all dashboards, reports, and flows
- Add, change, or remove users and their permission level

Admins can create new entities, relationships, and fields - as well as configure the labels and styling of the knowledge graph model.

#### Editor

- Can view the complete data model
- Can add, modify, or delete data
- Access to selected dashboards, reports, and flows

This allows trusted users to maintain information without changing the structure of your knowledge graph.

#### Viewer

- Can view the data model
- Can view all data within the knowledge graph
- Cannot make any changes to data or data model ("schema")

This is perfect for stakeholders who need to analyze information but shouldn't modify it.

#### Public

- Can view selected data that has been specifically shared
- Cannot see the underlying data model

## Why Permissions Matter

#### Data Security

Protects sensitive information by ensuring only authorized users can access or modify certain data.

#### Workflow Control

Prevents accidental changes by limiting editing capabilities to appropriate users.

#### Collaboration

Enables teamwork by allowing different levels of interaction based on role and responsibility.

#### Controlled Sharing

Facilitates sharing insights with clients or the public without exposing your entire knowledge base.
