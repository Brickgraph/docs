# Dashboards

Brickgraph offers the option to create dashboard pages to visualise your knowledge graph data in cards, charts, maps, and tables. These pages can be configured with the Brickgraph team.

### Default Page

All Brickgraph organizations have access to a default dashboard layout to provide insight and visualizations of your knowledge graph. This dashboard provides an overview of total entities and relationships, distribution of entity and relationship types, and most connected/disconnected entities.
