# Flows

Flows are Brickgraph's way to enable users to execute more complex operations. Each flow is composed of one or more **tasks** that operate in sequence to unlock automation for your organization. Flows must be configured with the Brickgraph team.

### Tasks

Flows enable much more complex operations than the Data Editor or Map by leveraging Tasks. These are operations that can be "chained" together to perform multi-step processes

Some examples of tasks;

- Custom forms for data entry
- Sending email
- Transforming data
- AI summaries
