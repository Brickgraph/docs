# Knowledge Graph

The Brickgraph Knowledge Graph is composed of two main elements; Model Builder and Data Editor. Together, these allow you to design and build your knowledge graph by defining (and refining) both the model and the data that populates your model.

###[Model Builder](/features/graph/model-builder)
The Model Builder is an interactive tool to design and build your unique knowledge graph data model. Create entities, relationships, and fields - along with customisation - to establish the foundation for your data.

###[Data Editor](/features/graph/data)
The Data Editor enables users to work with their data. Create, update, or delete entities and relationships in your knowledge graph with an Excel-like interface designed for easy data management.
