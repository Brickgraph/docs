# Reports

Brickgraph offers the option to create custom extracts from your knowledge graph that can be either directly downloaded or retrieved from the API. These reports can be configured with the Brickgraph team.

### Default Reports

ðŸ”œ Coming soon...

### Custom Reports

Reports can be downloaded as CSV files directly from the Reports page. They are listed alongside a description, an id value, and a permission level. Clicking the "Download" button will download the data directly.

#### ID Value

Each report must have an ID value that is required if retrieving the report data via the API.

#### Permission

Each report also has a minimum permission level to retrieve the report. When a user attempts to download or retrieve the report via API Brickgraph will check to ensure that this user has sufficient organization permission to retrieve that report.
