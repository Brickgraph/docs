# Navigating the app

There are a few different ways to navigate the features and functionality of Brickgraph but it is fairly straightforward - with a few shortcuts as you get more comfortable.

### Sidebar menu

This is the easiest way to navigate to Brickgraph features. If working on mobile or a small tablet screen the sidebar is automatically minimised but can be quickly accessed through the "hamburger" button in the bottom left corner. On desktop and larger screens the sidebar menu will always be available - and you can choose to minimise or expand it as you'd like by pressing the icon in the upper right corner of the menu.

### Top bar

This is where you can manage your account or organization, and access Brickgraph's quick search and expanded menu.

##### Quick search

Simply type into the search bar and Brickgraph will search across your entire organization for any entity that matches. This is a fast and easy way to jump into details about a given entity, such as it's associated data or related graph entities and relationships.

##### Expanded menu

The expanded menu is the fastest way to jump straight into data views or the schema editor. It also has additional links that you may not use as often but help to expand the functionality and features for your organization.

##### User profile

Clicking on your user avatar in the top right corner will open your profile menu. From here you can change your display name, photo, and change security settings - such as your password.

##### organization picker

To the left of your user profile button is the organization switcher. This allows you to toggle between organizations, create a new organization, or jump to the organization management page (provided that you have permission).
