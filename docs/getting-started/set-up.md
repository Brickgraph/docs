# Set up Brickgraph

Brickgraph is designed for teams to collaborate on data - on both the details and the structure - so it all starts with your organisation because this is how you can work together with your teams. This section will step through how you can set up your account, create or join an organisation, and get ready to build your initial schema.

### Creating an account

Getting up and running is easy. Simply [sign up here](https://app.brickgraph.io)
to start. You'll be prompted to sign in, but if you don't have an account you can click the link
at the bottom of the modal to create one.
