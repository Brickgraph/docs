# Creating an account

Brickgraph is designed for teams to collaborate on data - on both the details and the structure - so it all starts with your organization because this is how you will together with your teams. This section will step through how you can set up your account, and create (or join) an organization.

### Creating an account

Getting up and running is easy. Simply [sign up here](https://app.brickgraph.io)
to start. You'll be prompted to sign in, but if you don't have an account you can click the link
at the bottom of the modal to create one.

You can choose to sign in using either Google account or simply with your email and a password. If you choose email and a password you will have to follow the instructions to confirm the account from the email sent to the one you signed up with. Once created you will be prompted to create an organization.
