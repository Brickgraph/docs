# Brickgraph

### What is Brickgraph?

_Simple, powerful knowledge graphs for ambitious real estate and built environment teams_

Brickgraph makes it easy to create powerful, flexible, and extensible knowledge graphs for your real estate or built environment teams. Visualise your organisation's data, extract key reports and insights, and plug into maps and external geospatial data - take your operations and data to a whole new level.

Use these Brickgraph Academy resources to learn more about the power of knowledge graphs and how to get the most value from using Brickgraph for your team.

### Knowledge graphs

Think of your data as a network - with _entities_ (like properties, or funds) connected by _relationships_ to other entities in the network - much like other networks we interact with everyday, like subway systems, or a social network of friends. Building and identifying relevant _connections_ across your network unlocks incredible possibilities so the graph structure for data is a great way to organise your internal information to maximise insights and save time working with your data. Historically however, this has required specialised coding and development skills to create but Brickgraph is designed to make the process of creating and maintaining knowledge graphs simple and valuable for teams of all sizes and skills.
